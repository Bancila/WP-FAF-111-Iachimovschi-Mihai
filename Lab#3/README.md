# Topic: Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve.
## Intro

## Completed Mandatory Objectives
* Draw few lines of different colors and weights
* Draw a Bezier curve
* Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
* Draw 2 different objects using mouse

## Completed Objectives With Points
* Draw a custom bitmap image **(1 pt)**
* Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects **(2 pt)**
* Draw a Bezier curve using mouse **(1 pt)**
* Fill an object with a gradient **(1 pt)**
* Use mouse as an eraser of a adjustable width **(2 pt)**

## The application creation steps
At this laboratory work I was procrastinating because of other important tasks, so, here come my laboratory work! ;)

![Mockup](https://raw.github.com/TUM-FAF/WP-FAF-111-Iachimovschi-Mihai/master/Lab%233/pics/mockup.png)

1. All requested tools in a groupbox.
2. Some config variables.
3. Custom bitmap image.
4. Bezier curve. You can draw bezier curve using mouse, just click and drag two times and you're done.
5. Drawing area.
6. Custom rectangle that will stand for color picking. I used ChooseColor Dialog.
7. Rectangle filled with gradient.
8. Text field used for border and eraser width.

## Outro
This laboratory work was quite complicated than the previous ones.
This time I encountered few problems that gave me some huge headaches. First problem was limiting the draw area.
I had a solution, but I've implemented it in a incorrect way, so I had to rethink it. Credits go to Roman Roibu.
Other were less important and I managed them all.

Overall things worked as expected, but there are a few things that I'd add, but now I have no time for it, I want to finish the laboratory work before 23:59:59.
