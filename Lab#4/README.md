# Topic: Windows Timer. Animation.
## Intro

## Completed Mandatory Objectives
* Create an animation based on Windows timer which involves at least 5 different drawn objects

## Completed Objectives With Points
* Increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel **(2 pt)**
* Solve flicking problem **(2 pt)**
* Add animated objects which interact with each other **(2-6 pt)**
* Animate a Nyan Cat that leaves a rainbow tail **(Math.floor(+30% for task with interacting objects))** aka **(0-1 pt)**

## The application creation steps
At this laboratory work I haven't created a sketch because the base UI is just a window with a active area.

## Result

## Outro
This laboratory work was quite interesting, I solved the flickering problem and was quite confortable with the winapi.
The Application presents a animation of a little fish that was drawn using trivial figures as triangles and ellipses. The fish is blinking :D
Overall the process of creating the app was straightforward, so I haven't face some serious issues.
